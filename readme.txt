To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to play junkrat. His grenades require insane skill to connect, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the shots will go over the enemy player's heads. There's also Junkrat's chaotic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his character, to realise that they're not just funny- that he says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Junkrat truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Junkrat's absolutely inspiring catchphrase "If at first you don't succeed, blow it up again!" which itself is a cryptic reference to Katya Volskaya's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Jeff Kaplan's genius sense of character design unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Junkers tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for my mercy girlfriend's eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 50 SR points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
